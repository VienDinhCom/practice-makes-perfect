# Practice Makes Perfect

I believe in practice—it’s almost like a religion to me. Doing, not just reading. That’s how I learn best.

I like project-based learning. Getting my hands dirty, especially in tech. Because theory is great, but building something? That’s where real understanding happens.

I also trust the basics. They free my mind. When you master the fundamentals, adapting to new technology feels natural—because tech evolves fast.

That’s why I created this repository. A place to sharpen my core skills and stay updated with the latest tech.

It’s simple: practice, adapt, grow.

## Fundamentals

I use **freeCodeCamp** to fill my knowledge gaps in full-stack development. It’s a well-known community-driven bootcamp that has helped thousands land jobs at tech companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Spotify and Amazon.
