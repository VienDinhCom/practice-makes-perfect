# Practice Makes Perfect

I believe in practice—it’s almost like a religion to me. Doing, not just reading. That’s how I learn best.

I like project-based learning. Getting my hands dirty, especially in tech. Because theory is great, but building something? That’s where real understanding happens.

I also trust the basics. They free my mind. When you master the fundamentals, adapting to new technology feels natural—because tech evolves fast.

That’s why I created this repository. A place to sharpen my core skills and stay updated with the latest tech.

It’s simple: practice, adapt, grow.

## Fundamentals

I use **freeCodeCamp** to fill my knowledge gaps in full-stack development. It’s a well-known community-driven bootcamp that has helped thousands land jobs at tech companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Spotify and Amazon.

## Projects

I started as a front-end developer—just building interfaces, making things look good. But over time, curiosity pulled me deeper. I wanted to understand the whole system, not just the surface. So, I evolved into a full-stack developer.

I have worked with agencies like Creative Haus, Cactus Themes, and Redline Coders. I have also been part of companies like Morph Ventures and Ventive. And sometimes, I went solo—freelancing on Upwork, tackling projects end-to-end.

Each experience shaped me. Different teams, different challenges. But the goal remained the same—solving problems, learning, and growing.
