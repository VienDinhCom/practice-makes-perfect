# Data Structures and Algorithms

You know, for the longest time, I avoided Data Structures and Algorithms. I thought, “Why bother? JavaScript has built-in methods, and libraries like Lodash handle everything.”

But then, I hit a wall—things like recursion and trees just didn’t click. I realized I was relying on tools without really understanding them.

So, I went back to the basics—sorting, searching, linked list, set, map, tree, graph, etc. And suddenly, coding felt different. Problems that once confused me started making sense.

I didn’t just write these data structures and algorithms in JavaScript; for review purposes, I also rewrote them in TypeScript and tested them with Deno.

And something clicked. I wasn’t just coding—I was thinking better, solving problems faster.

It turns out, shortcuts only get me so far. Understanding the foundation? That changed everything for me as a developer.
