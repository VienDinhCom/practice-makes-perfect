# React Query in Practice

Back in 2022, I used React Query with GraphQL for my Next Shopify Storefront. It was good… but limited. Fast forward to now—React Query has evolved. A lot. So I revisited it.

This project became my deep dive into the new API: from caching with query keys, to optimistic updates, pagination, even working with TanStack Router.

Each lesson—like retries, cancellations, or prefetching—feels like solving a small puzzle. Practical stuff, but also philosophical.

Because at its core, it’s about asking: how can we manage uncertainty in our apps… and maybe in life too? That's what this journey is really about.
