# Relational Database

You know, I used to avoid writing raw SQL. I relied on ORMs like Prisma or TypeORM to handle everything for me. It worked—until I realized I didn’t really understand databases.

So, I took a deep dive. Learned how to create and manage relational databases with PostgreSQL. Got my hands dirty with SQL—actually writing queries, optimizing them. Along the way, I picked up more Bash and Git too.

I also sharpen my skills even further with exercises at [pgexercises.com](../database-postgresql-exercises/). Because knowing SQL? It’s not just useful—it’s essential. And I’m finally starting to appreciate why.
