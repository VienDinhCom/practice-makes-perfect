# Front End Development Libraries

I’ve built a lot of websites—used BEM, Tailwind, Bootstrap, Sass, jQuery, React, Redux—you name it. But this course took my skills deeper.

I dived into Bootstrap and jQuery, then added logic to CSS using Sass. Next, I built a shopping cart—really got into React and Redux, crafting powerful single-page apps.

And finally, I pushed further, using TypeScript, React, and Vite to build certification projects.

It wasn’t just about learning tools. It made me think like a developer—structured, creative, efficient. And that changed everything.
