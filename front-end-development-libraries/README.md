# Front End Development Libraries

In the Front End Development Libraries Certification, I learned how to style your site quickly with Bootstrap. I also learned how to add logic to your CSS styles and extend them with Sass.

Later, I built applications to learn how to create powerful Single Page Applications (SPAs) with React and Redux.
