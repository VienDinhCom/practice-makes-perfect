# Back End Development and APIs

You know, I’ve worked with different ways to build APIs—Express.js, Next.js, serverless, even GraphQL with Hasura. But this course took me deeper.

I really got to understand HTTP—methods, headers, status codes, all the little details. I built backend apps with Node.js, used Express for web applications, and created microservices with MongoDB and Mongoose.

I also learned to run MongoDB using Docker and Docker Compose. That was a game changer for development.

It’s one thing to use tools—it’s another to really understand them. And that’s what this course helped me do.
