# AI Playground

I built this little AI playground because I wanted a space to explore, to tinker, and to understand these tools on my own terms.

It’s simple, really. I have a few setups running. One is Ollama, where I can run independent scripts and experiment freely. Another is OpenAI, connected through a Deno proxy, which lets me see how a more structured system behaves. Then there’s TypeChat, which is interactive—I can have a back-and-forth, test ideas, and watch the AI respond in real time.

I like thinking of it as a sandbox. Each system has its quirks, its way of interpreting instructions, and its own rhythm. By trying them side by side, I learn not just what AI can do, but how I think, how I communicate, and how I can use these tools to extend my own creativity.

It’s not about complexity—it’s about curiosity, clarity, and exploration.
