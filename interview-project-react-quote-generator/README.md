# React Quote Generator

Quote Image Generator built with [React.js](https://react.dev/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Shopify Polaris](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/polaris), [React Query](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tanstack/react-query), etc.

## Experience

Funny story. A Shopify agency—I forget their name—gave me this React.js test. I built it, passed, and got invited to the next round. But by then, I’d already accepted another job.

For this project, I used [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) to build APIs, [Text2PNG](https://www.npmjs.com/package/text2png) and [Jimp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp) to generate images on the server, [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) for API interactions, [Shopify Polaris](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/polaris) for the UI, [React Query](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tanstack/react-query) for state management, and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for Server-Side Rendering.

It was a good challenge. And in the end, it led me somewhere else. Life works like that sometimes.
