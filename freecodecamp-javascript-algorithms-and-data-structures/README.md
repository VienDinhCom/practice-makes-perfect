# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

You know, I’ve been building apps with React and Node for years. But this course—it pushed me deeper. It made me rethink the basics.

I revisited JavaScript fundamentals—variables, loops, objects, the DOM. Then, I explored Object-Oriented and Functional Programming, sharpened my algorithmic thinking, and learned to fetch data efficiently.

After building projects with HTML, JavaScript and Bootstrap, I took it further. I rewrote them in TypeScript, then tested them with Deno.

It wasn’t just about learning—it was about refining. Strengthening the foundation. Because mastery isn’t about knowing—it’s about understanding, applying, and evolving.
