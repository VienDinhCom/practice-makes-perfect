# Quality Assurance

I’ve worked with Jest, React Testing Library, and Deno Test before, but with this course, I took things deeper.

I learned to write tests using Chai and run them with Mocha, making sure my applications behave as expected.

I also set up MongoDB with Docker, built a chat app, and explored advanced Node and Express concepts. Along the way, I used Pug for templating, Passport for authentication, and Socket.io for real-time communication.

Unit testing, functional testing—every piece fits together. More than just tools, it was about building confidence in my code.
