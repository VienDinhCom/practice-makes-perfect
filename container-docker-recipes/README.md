# Docker Recipes

This is my Docker recipes small, self-contained kitchens where software can cook itself without touching the rest of your system. I’ve built ones for coding, for running apps with graphics, for sound, even for safe experiments as a non-root user.

Each recipe is a simple set of instructions. One might run VS Code inside a container. Another spins up Wayland or Xorg for graphical apps. Some handle sound through PulseAudio or PipeWire. Others ensure you stay safe in a minimal Linux environment, like Alpine or Debian, without root privileges.

I rename, tweak, and organize these containers so they’re easy to use and understand. The goal isn’t complexity—it’s clarity and portability. They’re my way of making software predictable, repeatable, and safe, so anyone can run it anywhere, anytime, without friction.
