# React PDF Reader

## Experience

In this project, I have used:

- FileReader API to read files
- React PDF JS to view PDF files
- Normalize CSS to reset default styles
- CSS Modules to write component-scoped styles

## Demonstration
https://react-pdf-reader.vercel.app/

## Usage

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
